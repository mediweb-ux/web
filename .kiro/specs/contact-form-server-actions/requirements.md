# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing contact form functionality by migrating from API routes to Next.js server actions for email handling. The system will continue to send confirmation emails to users and notification emails to the site owner using Resend, but with improved server-side handling, better error management, and enhanced user experience through server actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to submit a contact form and receive a confirmation email, so that I know my message was successfully sent and have a record of what I submitted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the contact form with valid data THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the user's provided email address
2. WHEN a user submits the contact form THEN the confirmation email SHALL contain a copy of their submitted message, selected contact reasons, and acknowledgment text
3. WHEN the email is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL display a success message to the user
4. IF the email sending fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
5. WHEN a user receives the confirmation email THEN it SHALL be formatted professionally and include all submitted form data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want to receive notification emails when users submit the contact form, so that I can respond to inquiries promptly and manage customer communications effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the contact form THEN the system SHALL send a notification email to the site owner's designated email address
2. WHEN the notification email is sent THEN it SHALL contain all form data including name, email, message, and selected contact reasons
3. WHEN the notification email is sent THEN it SHALL include the user's email address for easy reply functionality
4. IF the notification email fails to send THEN the system SHALL log the error but still send the confirmation email to the user
5. WHEN the site owner receives the notification THEN it SHALL be clearly formatted and distinguish between user confirmation and owner notification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Next.js server actions for form handling instead of API routes, so that I can leverage better server-side integration, improved error handling, and enhanced security features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contact form is submitted THEN the system SHALL use Next.js server actions instead of API routes
2. WHEN using server actions THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing form validation using the current Zod schema
3. WHEN using server actions THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing honeypot spam protection mechanism
4. WHEN server actions are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide better error handling and user feedback
5. WHEN server actions are used THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing form state management and user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for email operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable communication with users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error messages to the user
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details
4. WHEN the Resend API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully and inform the user appropriately
5. WHEN form submission succeeds partially (e.g., user email sent but owner notification fails) THEN the system SHALL log the partial failure but still show success to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the form submission process to provide clear feedback and maintain good performance, so that I have confidence in the system and a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit the form THEN the system SHALL show loading states during processing
2. WHEN the form is being processed THEN the submit button SHALL be disabled to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN the submission is complete THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback about the result
4. WHEN the submission succeeds THEN the system SHALL reset the form and show a success message with option to send another message
5. WHEN I interact with the form THEN the response times SHALL be optimized through server actions' efficient server-side processing
